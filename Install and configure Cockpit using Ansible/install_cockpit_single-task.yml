        # #     Note - Ansible Lightspeed used the generic "Start and enable service" prompt

        # # 3b. Uncomment the "module_defaults" section at the top of the Playbook.
        # # 3c. Clear current task suggestion and request updated suggestion.
        # #     Note - Ansible Lightspeed used the full Playbook context and evaluated the "module_defaults"
        # #            when generating a suggestion.
        # #            The updated suggestion no longer includes "enabled:" and "state:" arguments.

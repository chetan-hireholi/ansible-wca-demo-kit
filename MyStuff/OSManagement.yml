    # TASK 1
    # This prompt will generate something close to what we want but not exactly. But it is pointing us 
    # to the right section in the ansible facts.
    # https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html
    # 
    # - name: Using the Ansible Facts, extract memory values and create variables with the values real free, real used and real total



    # TASK 2
    # This prompt contains enough details to have a consice and exact code block
    #
    - name: From the Ansible facts ansible_memory_mb.real, create variables with the free, used and total memory in mb
    
    
    # TASK 3
    # Using the variables generated previsously, we want the code to compute used memory in percentage
    # Show that the engine may not be aware that we are dealing with strings   
    #   second prompt: Convert variables to int and compute the percentage value of the used memory
    - name: Compute the percentage value of the used memory
    

    # TASK 4
    # Using the same approach, extract the free memory in percentage
    - name: Using the variables generated previously, we want the code to compute the free memory in percentage   


    # TASK 5
    # See how changing the prompt may be necessary to include all the variables in the message.
    # Add: and the computed percentage on the second generation
    - name: Print the value of all the memory variables

    # TASK 1
    # This prompt will generate something close to what we want but not exactly. But it is pointing us

    # https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html
    # 
    # - name: Using the Ansible Facts, extract memory values and create variables with the values real free, real used and real total


    # TASK 2
    # This prompt contains enough details to have a consice and exact code block
    #
    # - name: Extract the ansible facts. From the facts ansible_memory_mb.real, create variables with the real free, real used and real total memory in mb   
  
    
    # TASK 3
    # Using the variables generated previsously, we want the code to compute used memory in percentage
    #    
    # - name: Compute the percentage value of the used memory from the variables
    
    # TASK 4
    # Using the same approach, extrat the free memory in percentage
    # - name: Using the variables generated previously, we want the code to compute the free memory in percentage
